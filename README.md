#Sentiment Analysis in Amazon Reviews
This repository contains the resolution for the final practice project of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course. The main objective of the project is to develop a complete workflow for a binary sentiment classification problem.

##📋 Project Description
The project is structured into four stages that cover the lifecycle of an NLP project: from downloading and exploring the data to evaluating predictive models. The main focus is the binary classification of reviews (positive vs. negative).

##📂 Repository Structure
The solution is divided into 4 notebooks, corresponding to each exercise in the practice:

###1. Data Download and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this stage, the corpus is downloaded and its main characteristics are analyzed. Metrics and visualizations are included, such as:

Vocabulary cardinality.

Analysis of the most frequent N-grams.

Word Clouds.

###2. Text Preprocessing
A Python function is implemented for cleaning and normalizing the reviews, preparing them for training. Tasks include the elimination of stopwords, punctuation marks, and format adaptation.

###3. Training and Testing
The problem is addressed as a supervised binary classification. Different models are trained and compared. The vectorizer parameters are justified.

###4. Metrics and Conclusions
Final report where the best model is selected, and its goodness is validated using metrics such as precision, recall, and f1-score. The final conclusions of the study are included.

##📊 Dataset
The Amazon Product Data was used, specifically the "5-core" automation subsets. Amazon Reviews (Julian McAuley)
